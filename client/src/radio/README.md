# ðŸ“» Pockets Radio

A modern web-based radio station system built with Gleam and Lustre, designed for the TandemX creative platform.

## Overview

Pockets Radio is a multi-channel streaming system that provides curated audio experiences for different moods and activities. Think Jet Set Radio meets modern podcast networks - each channel has its own personality, playlist, and bumpers.

## Architecture

- **`radio.css`** - Glassmorphism-inspired styling for the radio interface

### Channel System
Each channel represents a different "station" with:
- **Theme**: Music, Talk, Character, or Ambient
