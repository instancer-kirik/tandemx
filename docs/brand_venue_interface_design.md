# Brand & Venue Interface Design Document

## Overview

The Brand & Venue Interface is a multi-sided marketplace extension to the TandemX platform that connects artists, brands, venues, and event organizers. This system enables comprehensive discovery and booking relationships where multiple parties can initiate connections:

1. **Artist-initiated**:
   - Artists discover and apply to venues for performance opportunities
   - Artists discover and apply to brands for sponsorship/collaboration
   - Artists discover resources (equipment, studios, etc.)

2. **Brand-initiated**:
   - Brands discover and invite artists for performances/endorsements
   - Brands discover and book venues for events

3. **Venue-initiated**:
   - Venues discover and invite artists to perform
   - Venues list their availability for bookings

This document outlines the design, functionality, and implementation plan for this extension, which will integrate with the existing Findry system.

## System Architecture

The Brand & Venue Interface will be implemented in two phases:

### Phase 1: Core Marketplace Functionality

- User profiles and authentication for brands/venues
- Discovery interfaces for all marketplace relationships
- Application/invitation system
- Basic scheduling and availability management
- Integration with existing Findry calendar system

### Phase 2: Advanced Event Planning

- Comprehensive event management tools
- Contract generation and management
- Payment processing and financial tracking
- Marketing and promotion tools
- Analytics and reporting

## User Types

1. **Artists**: Existing users from Findry system
2. **Brands**: Companies looking to hire artists and book venues for events
3. **Venues**: Performance spaces looking to book artists and be booked by brands
4. **Event Organizers**: Entities planning events that require artistic talent and venues
5. **Resource Providers**: Studios, equipment rentals, and other resources for artists (Phase 2)

## Marketplace Relationships

The platform will support the following discovery and booking relationships:

```
